MyoChallenge
========================================
The Myosuite Team organised MyoChallenge to tackle difficult problems in top-level machine learning conference.
Our latest challenge is accepted to NeuIPs 2024.

MyoChallenge-2022: Learning Physiological Dexterity
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introducing `MyoChallenge - a NeurIPS 2022 <https://sites.google.com/view/myochallenge>`__ competition track on learning contact-rich manipulation skills for a physiologically 
realistic musculo-skeletal hand. The goal of MyoChallenge is to push our understanding of physiological motor-control responsible
for nimble and agile movements of the human body. In the current edition of MyoChallenge, 
we are focusing on developing controllers for contact rich dexterous manipulation behaviors. 
This challenge builds upon the MyoSuite ecosystem -- a fast (>4000x faster) and contact-rich framework 
for musculoskeletal motor control. 




Competition Tracks
The MyoChallenge consists of two tracks:

MyoChallenge-2023: Towards Human-Level Dexterity and Agility
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introducing `MyoChallenge 2023 <https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite/myochallenge/myochallenge-2023>`__: Towards Human-Level Dexterity and Agility

Humans effortlessly grasp objects of diverse shapes and properties and execute 
agile locomotion without overwhelming their cognitive capacities. This ability was acquired 
through millions of years of evolution, which honed the symbiotic relationship between the central and 
peripheral nervous systems and the musculoskeletal structure. Consequently, it is not surprising that 
uncovering the intricacies of these complex, evolved systems underlying human movement remains a formidable 
challenge. Advancements in neuromechanical simulations and data driven methods offer promising avenues to 
overcome these obstacles. This yearâ€™s competition will feature two tracks: the manipulation track and the locomotion track.
