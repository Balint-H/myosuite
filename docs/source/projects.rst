Examplar Projects with Myosuite
======================================

.. _projects:


For ease of getting started, MyoSuite comes prepackaged with a set of pre-trained baselines.
See `here <https://github.com/facebookresearch/myosuite/tree/main/myosuite/agents>`_ for our complete set of baselines.

In total, three different types of baselines are provided:

* :ref:`myochallenge`
    * :ref:`myo_challenge_22`
    * :ref:`myo_challenge_23`
    * :ref:`myo_challenge_24`
* :ref:`pub_with_myosuite`
    * :ref:`myodex`

MyoChallenge
========================================

MyoChallenge-2022
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Muscle Fatigue is a short-term (second to minutes) effect that happens after sustained or repetitive voluntary movement
and it has been linked to traumas e.g. cumulative trauma disorder (Chaffin et al. (2006)).
A dynamic muscle fatigue model (Ma et al. (2009)) was integrated into the modeling framework.
This model was based on the idea that different types of muscle fiber that have different contributions
and resistance to fatigue (Vøllestad (1997)).
The current implementation is simplified to consider the same fatigue factor for all muscles and
that muscle can be completely fatigued.
